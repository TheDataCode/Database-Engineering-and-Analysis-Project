## An OLTP Database Design and Analysis Project for a Restaurant Chain

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
An end-to-end task of designing and testing an Online Transaction Processing database system to accommodate the increasing demand for in-person and online transactions across several countries.
The restaurant currently stores its data in a spreadsheet for each branch. This adoption is necessary to streamline operations, management and coordination.
As part of this project, comprehensive data analysis will be conducted to gain valuable insights from the existing data for each country.      
Factors include customer demographics, sales trends, order patterns, and preferences.

- ### Stored Procedures
  Data manipulation using stored procedures and transactions in a database provide a structured and controlled approach to database operations, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and security while promoting code reusability and performance optimisation.

 - ### Prepared Statement
    prepared statements in MySQL offer performance optimisation, protection against SQL injection attacks, increased security, improved       code maintainability, readability, and database portability. They are essential for building secure, efficient, and            maintainable database-driven applications.
